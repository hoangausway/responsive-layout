# responsive-layout
An example of responsive layout. Build a responsive dashboard with Grid and Flexbox.
## Why?
Make a web page responsive is not trivial task. Even with the help of Grid and Flexbox.

I found that Matt Holland gave a how-to with super explanation in his article ["Build a Responsive, Modern Dashboard Layout With CSS Grid and Flexbox"](https://medium.com/better-programming/build-a-responsive-modern-dashboard-layout-with-css-grid-and-flexbox-bd343776a97e).

In the article, Matt uses traditional CSS with jQuery. I would like to give a try with styled-components and React.

For easy tracking the concepts explaining in Matt's article, I keep all styling attributes the same. Just do "translate" them to styled-component "language".
