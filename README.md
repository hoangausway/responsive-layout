# responsive-layout
An example of responsive layout. Build a responsive layout for modern dashboard with Grid and Flexbox.
## Why?
Make a web page responsive is not trivial task. Even with the help of Grid and Flexbox.

I found a great article ["Build a Responsive, Modern Dashboard Layout With CSS Grid and Flexbox"](https://medium.com/better-programming/build-a-responsive-modern-dashboard-layout-with-css-grid-and-flexbox-bd343776a97e).

In the article Matt Holland gave an excellent explanation about key concepts and how to implement.
For illustration he uses traditional **CSS** with **jQuery**.

Here we will give it a try with **styled-components** and **React**.

For easy tracking the concepts explained in Matt's article, I keep all styling attributes the same. Just do "translate" them to styled-component "language".

## Keywords
grid, flexbox, auto-fit, column-count, column-break-inside, transform

## Steps
The App.js in the project is final codes. To keep track the steps from very generic responsive layout, I put the codes of App.js for each step in the files App-step*.js. Just simply replace codes to App.js.

## Step 1: Generic, responsive layout with header, main, footer and side sections.
Dependencies: react, styled-components
## Step 2: Add responsive grid introduction cards in main.
Dependencies: react, styled-components

## Step 3: Add responsive cards with dynamic heights.
Dependencies: react, styled-components

## Step 4: Mobile-first. Making side nav slidable on mobile devices.
Dependencies: react, styled-components

## Step 5: Javascript. Click to show/hide side nav.
Dependencies: react, styled-components, styled-icons

## Step 6: Cleanup. Move styled components to a separate file. (Optional)
Dependencies: react, styled-components, styled-icons
